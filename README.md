# startwithn8n
n8n workflow that automates tasks with Google Sheets, Gmail, HTTP requests, Telegram, and Google Tasks. Data can be tested via Postman or adapted from forms and other apps.

# This flow integrates multiple services: it connects with Google Sheets, sends emails via Gmail, makes HTTP requests, and uses Telegram to send a message to each registered user. Additionally, it creates tasks in Google Tasks. For testing purposes, Iâ€™m currently sending data from Postman, but you can also create a form or use another application to test the workflow.
